<h3>Instructions about how to use the Analysis Support System</h3>

<p>It is very simple to use our website:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:50px;">
    <li>Click on "Choose File" to upload the report.</li>
    <li>Give some time to process the report.</li>
    <li>You can use all the features once the report is processed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving on to how to use the search option:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the Search Field, find all the column headings such as:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>id</li>
        <li>report date</li>
        <li>reference report source</li>
        <li>report description</li>
        <li>persons and dates, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Use the search text field to enter the information you want to search for.</li>
    <li>This gives you more control over the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using the timeline technique:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each event is displayed with its ID in timeline order.</li>
    <li>If two events occurred in the same time period, they will be stacked on top for better readability.</li>
    <li>Clicking on any event will display more information about it on the left side of the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>We created an attractive network graph:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The graph is color-coded with red nodes representing places, blue nodes representing suspects, and yellow nodes symbolizing organizations.</li>
    <li>This type of graph helps Emma easily identify important suspects and organizations connected to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the crime by country technique:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A bar graph represents each country on the X-axis.</li>
    <li>The total number of crimes is on the Y-axis.</li>
    <li>Hovering the mouse over any specific graph will provide the total number of crime rates in that country.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the crime by month technique:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A bar graph represents each month with a number on the X-axis.</li>
    <li>The total number of crimes is on the Y-axis.</li>
    <li>Hovering the mouse over any specific graph will provide the total number of crime counts in that month.</li>
</ul>
